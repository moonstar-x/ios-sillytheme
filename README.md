Simply silly. The silliest icon pack you'll find on iOS for Anemone. Based on a little challenge I made for myself: colors are eye picked and used only the brush tool with the same brush size for everything. This was just a little personal project that I did with my use in mind, the icons I've skinned are limited. If you liked what I've made and would like me to make other icons, message me on [Reddit (u/moonstar-x)](https://www.reddit.com/user/moonstar-x), I'll try to answer your message and update the package as soon as possible. Thank you.

## To do:
* Complete the iconset for all the system icons.
* Add more icons for third-party apps.
* Add a custom boot logo.
